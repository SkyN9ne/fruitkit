# FruitKit

Simple rootkit made in C. Has a UAC bypass, dynamically calls functions to avoid AV hooks, remade LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress, cuz AV hooks those too sometimes
Also makes some kernel level function calls. 

Thanks a lot to Mathew S for helping me with this. This rootkit is inspired by his, and is pretty much a simpler version of it. his github is https://github.com/mstefanowich
